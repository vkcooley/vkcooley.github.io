*Basel*

Basel was a great starting point for this trip as it is very well connected via train to other nearby cities. I came from Heidelberg via Karlsruhe (there are several direct ICE trains from Karlsruhe, which is about a 40min S-bahn/regional train ride from Heidelberg) and my friend came from Milan (many options from here as well - I love the EC train as it is direct!).

We only had one half day and night in Basel, and while it would've been nice to have had longer, we felt is was sufficient to get a feel for the city and wander around a bit. We walked from our hotel near BarfÃ¼sserplatz/Steinenvorstadt to Marktplatz and admired the [Rathaus](https://maps.app.goo.gl/K9T6nhM3HMgcCoL27) (City Hall) and popped in and out of stores. We continued to walk south parallel to the Rhine River and stopped to check out the [Basler MÃ¼nster](https://maps.app.goo.gl/d1awtGjc5BimuyV3A) (Basel Minster - large gothic-style Protestant cathedral). We then made our way closer to the Rhine and found this adorable pottery shop [Motel a Miio](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JWcigDbABMdGax7Q6). All of the ceramics are handmade in Portugal ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹ and are truly stunning!

Shortly after we crossed over the Mittlere BrÃ¼cke, which links the older and newer parts of Basel, and was a great place to take photos of the Rhine and the surrounding buildings. We walked for a bit along the Rhine and then found a spot to chill along the river. We each got a glass of WeiÃŸweinschorle (very popular in Germany - white wine mixed with sparkling water) and enjoyed the the remaining sun for the day and views of the Rhine. For dinner we went to a pizza place called [Margherita](https://maps.app.goo.gl/z3FgCtDjWd96wc5R8) (I know, having Italian food while in Switz!) and overall we were pretty happy with the food.
